# Event's ticket booking simple application

## Description

This is a very basic Java-based web application. The application is based on the MVC pattern and uses a MySQL database to store the data.

It was created by [:bust_in_silhouette: Kar](https://github.com/kartikkumar-462) and me as we practiced our pair programming skills while learning Spring Boot for the first time in the University of Leicester's "Software Architecture and System Development" module.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 (recommended)
- MySQL (MySQL Workbench and MySQL Server are used in this project)
- Gradle

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Esh07/Events-Ticket-Booking-App.git
   ```

2. To create the database and database user, follow the instructions at [Database Setup](https://github.com/Esh07/Module-Timetable-Management-System-RESTful-API/blob/main/Documentation.md#database) in the documentation.

3. To run the application, go to `src/main/java/co2103/hw2` and run the `Hw2Application.java` file.

4. To access the application, go to `http://localhost:8080/list` in your browser.
   > Note: The root path is `/list`, not `/`. Without the `/list` path, you will get a Whitelabel Error Page.
